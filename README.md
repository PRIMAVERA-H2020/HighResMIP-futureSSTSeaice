# HighResMIP-futureSSTSeaice
Code used to create CMIP6 HighResMIP (Haarsma et al. 2016) future SST and sea-ice forcing datasets

The CMIP6 HighResMIP Tier 3 experiments include an atmosphere-only simulation for 2015-2050, driven by an imposed 
SST and sea-ice forcing dataset. This future forcing data needs a methodology for creation.

We use a combination of historic observed variability, combined with the climate change signal from a group of CMIP5 simulations (historical and RCP8.5), to project into the future.

This datasets is only meant for HighResMIP forcing, to enable a comparison of models driven by the same forcing in the future, for example to compare climate extremes in high and low resolution models under the same forcing. It is not a projection, and should not be taken as such.

A longer description of the construction of these datasets is contained in
