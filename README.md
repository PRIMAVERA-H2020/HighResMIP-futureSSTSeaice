# HighResMIP-futureSSTSeaice
Code used to create CMIP6 HighResMIP future SST and sea-ice forcing datasets

The CMIP6 HighResMIP Tier 3 experiments include an atmosphere-only simulation for 2015-2050, driven by given
SST and sea-ice forcing dataset. The future data has to be created in some way.

We use a combination of historic observed variability, combined with the climate change signal from a group of CMIP5
simulations (historical and RCP8.5), to project into the future.

This datasets is only meant for HighResMIP forcing, to enable a comparison of models driven by the same forcing in the future,
for example to compare climate extremes in high and low resolution models under the same forcing.

A longer description of the construction of these datasets is contained in
